2025-08-26T14:51:46: WARN  .Path when the page is backed by a file is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. We plan to use Path for a canonical source path and you probably want to check the source is a file. To get the current behaviour, you can use a construct similar to the one below:
2025-08-26T14:51:46: 
2025-08-26T14:51:46:   {{ $path := "" }}
2025-08-26T14:51:46:   {{ with .File }}
2025-08-26T14:51:46: 	{{ $path = .Path }}
2025-08-26T14:51:46:   {{ else }}
2025-08-26T14:51:46: 	{{ $path = .Path }}
2025-08-26T14:51:46:   {{ end }}
