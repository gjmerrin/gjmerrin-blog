This cross-national longitudinal study examined how social role transitions (education, employment, relationships) influence polysubstance use patterns during the critical transition from adolescence to young adulthood.

## Key Contributions

- **Cross-National Design**: Comparison of patterns across Australia and United States
- **Polysubstance Focus**: Examined co-occurring patterns rather than individual substances
- **Social Role Theory**: Investigated how role transitions influence substance use
- **Advanced Methods**: Used multidimensional growth mixture models

## Major Findings

The study revealed that:
- Successfully transitioning into adult roles reduces problematic substance use
- Employment and educational engagement serve as protective factors
- Romantic relationship formation impacts substance use trajectories
- Cross-national similarities suggest universal developmental processes

## Implications

This work informs:
- Prevention strategies targeting transition periods
- Policy supporting educational and vocational engagement
- Understanding of protective social roles
- International collaboration on substance use prevention
