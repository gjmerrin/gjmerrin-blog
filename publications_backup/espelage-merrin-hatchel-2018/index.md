abstract: This study examined the moderating role of school violence and peer victimization on the associ- ation between sexual orientation and mental health. The sample consisted of 11,794 high school students across 23 schools. Participants completed a self-report survey that assessed sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender identity, victimization experiences (e.g., peer and dating), perceptions of school violence and crime, as well as anxiety and suicidality. Multilevel analyses indicated that lesbian, gay, bisexual, questioning, and transgender (LGBTQ) individuals with lower rates of victimization had significantly lower rates of suicidality compared to LGBTQ individuals with higher rates of victimization. LGBTQ individuals in schools with high student perceptions of school violence and crime had higher suicidality than their non-LGBTQ counterparts. LGBTQ youth in schools with lower school violence and crime levels had lower rates of suicidality than their non-LGBTQ counterparts. Interventions need to consider multiple forms of victimization and school environment as potential risk and protective factors for LGBTQ youth.

summary: This study addresses several significant gaps in the literature by (1) examining peer victimization, perceptions of school violence and crime, and TDV victimization among LGBTQ and non-LGBTQ high school students as predictors of anxiety and suicidality; (2) evaluating the extent to which victimization, perceptions of school violence and crime, and TDV moderate the association between sexual orientation and the aforementioned mental health issues; and (3) testing victimization, perceptions of school violence and crime, and TDV as school-level (between-school) predictors of these outcomes.
