This systematic review, the companion to the bullying and ACEs review, examined how adverse childhood experiences affect adolescent peer relationships and social functioning. The review synthesized two decades of empirical research to understand the complex relationships between early trauma and peer outcomes.

## Key Findings

The review revealed important differential effects of ACE types on peer relationships:

- **Threat-based ACEs** associated with deviant peer involvement and aggressive social behaviors
- **Deprivation-based ACEs** linked to lower friendship quality and reduced peer support
- **Complex ACE patterns** showed unique peer relationship profiles

## Methodological Insights

This work highlighted:
- Limitations of traditional cumulative ACE scoring
- Importance of person-centered analytical approaches
- Need for longitudinal studies of ACE-peer relationship dynamics
- Value of considering ACE timing and chronicity

## Practice Implications

The findings inform:
- Targeted peer intervention strategies for trauma-exposed youth
- School-based social skills programming
- Peer support network development
- Trauma-informed peer relationship interventions
