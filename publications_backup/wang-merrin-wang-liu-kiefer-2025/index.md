abstract: "This study used person-centered methods to uncover that different groupings of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) were associated with very different patterns of peer relationship outcomes, challenging the utility of traditional cumulative ACE models."

This empirical study extended systematic review findings by using person-centered analytical approaches to examine how different patterns of co-occurring adverse childhood experiences relate to later peer relationship outcomes during adolescence.

## Methodological Innovation

The study employed latent class analysis to:
- Identify distinct patterns of co-occurring ACEs
- Examine heterogeneity in ACE experiences
- Link ACE patterns to specific peer outcomes
- Challenge traditional cumulative scoring approaches

## Key Findings

- Different ACE patterns showed unique associations with peer outcomes
- Threat-based ACE patterns linked to aggressive peer behaviors
- Deprivation-based patterns associated with social withdrawal
- Complex patterns revealed nuanced peer relationship profiles

## Implications

This work demonstrates the importance of:
- Person-centered approaches to ACE research
- Recognition of ACE heterogeneity
- Tailored intervention strategies
- Moving beyond simple cumulative models
