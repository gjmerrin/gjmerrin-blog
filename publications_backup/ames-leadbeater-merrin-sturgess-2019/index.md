abstract: Purpose - We examined how heterogeneity in the patterns of adolescent experiences of different types and severity of peer victimization is associated with concurrent and longitudinal mental health, substance use, and physical health. Method - Data come from a randomly recruited community-based sample of youth (T1 ages 12–18; N = 662; 52% female) followed biennially across 10 years (T6 ages 22–29; n = 478; 55% female). Results - Using latent class analysis, we identified four classes of adolescent peer victimization - Low victimization (63%), Physical victimization only (15%), Relational victimization only (17%), and Poly-victimization (6%). Youth in the Poly-victimization class reported the most detrimental health consequences in adolescence (e.g., internalizing and externalizing symptoms, illicit drug use, physical symptoms, poor physical self-concept, physical activity) and in young adulthood (e.g., depressive symptoms, sleep problems). Youth in the Relational and Physical victimization classes also reported health problems, some of which persisted into young adulthood. Youth in the Low victimization class reported the fewest health concerns. Conclusions - Findings add to our understanding of how different types of adolescent victimization are related to mental health, substance use, and physical health problems both within adolescence and long-term.

summary: We examine how heterogeneity in adolescent experiences of peer victimization impact health in adolescence and young adulthood. We include multiple indicators of mental health - internalizing symptoms (i.e., depressive and anxiety symptoms), externalizing symptoms (i.e., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) symptoms, and conduct problems), and substance use (i.e., smoking, heavy drinking, marijuana and illicit drug use). We also use multiple measures of physical health - subjective health (i.e., physical symptoms and physical self-concept), health-promoting behaviors (i.e., physical activity, healthy eating practices, and sleep duration and problems), and cardiometabolic risks (i.e., BMI waist circumference, and hypertension). In examining young adult health, we directly control for earlier (i.e., baseline) symptoms in order account for stability in health over time.
