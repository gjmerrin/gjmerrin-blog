abstract: "Through a comprehensive two-part systematic review synthesizing over 140 empirical studies spanning twenty years, this work demonstrates that adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with higher rates of adolescent bullying perpetration and victimization (bully-victims). However, the types of ACEs have different effects on mental health and peer-related outcomes, challenging traditional cumulative ACE models."

This landmark systematic review synthesized over 140 empirical studies spanning two decades to examine the relationships between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and bullying during adolescence. The findings demonstrate that ACEs are associated with higher rates of adolescent bullying perpetration and victimization, with bully-victims showing the strongest associations.

## Key Contributions

- **Comprehensive Scope**: Synthesized 20 years of research on ACEs and bullying
- **Methodological Innovation**: Challenged traditional cumulative ACE models
- **High Impact**: Downloaded over 15,500 times with 40 citations since publication
- **Practice Implications**: Informed trauma-informed approaches in schools

## Major Findings

The review revealed that different types of ACEs have distinct effects on bullying behaviors:
- **Threat-based ACEs** (physical/sexual abuse) strongly associated with aggressive behavior
- **Deprivation-based ACEs** (emotional neglect) linked to victimization experiences
- **Cumulative models** may obscure important differential effects

## Implications for Prevention

This work emphasizes the need for:
- Person-centered approaches to understanding ACE patterns
- Tailored trauma-informed practices in schools
- Recognition of ACE heterogeneity in intervention design
- Enhanced support for youth with complex trauma histories
