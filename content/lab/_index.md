# The **M**ethodology, **A**dolescent Development, and **P**roblem Behavior (MAP) Lab

Welcome to the MAP Lab at Syracuse University, directed by Dr. Gabriel J. Merrin. Our lab is dedicated to advancing our understanding of adolescent development while translating research findings into practical prevention and intervention strategies that improve outcomes for young people.

## Our Mission

The MAP Lab leverages innovative methods and advanced statistical approaches to understand how adolescents' experiences across multiple contexts (families, peers, schools, and communities) influence developmental trajectories. We are particularly committed to improving outcomes for marginalized youth and addressing disparities in adolescent wellbeing.

## Research Focus Areas

### **Identity-Based Harassment & Victimization**
Examining the development, persistence, and consequences of bias-based harassment among adolescents, with special attention to LGBTQ+ youth and other marginalized populations.

### **Prevention Science & Intervention Evaluation**
Rigorous evaluation of school-based prevention programs using advanced statistical methods including growth mixture modeling, latent class analysis, and machine learning approaches.

### **Social-Emotional Learning**
Understanding differential effectiveness of SEL programming across diverse student populations and identifying key mechanisms of change.

### **Advanced Quantitative Methods**
Developing and applying innovative statistical approaches to better understand complex developmental processes, including:
- Longitudinal mixture modeling
- Network analysis
- Machine learning applications in prevention science
- Reproducible research workflows

## Recent Projects

### **Peer Experiences Project** (2021-2024)
**NIJ-funded nationwide study | Co-I: Dr. Gabriel J. Merrin**

A three-year longitudinal study examining bias-based harassment among adolescents using a nationally representative sample. This collaboration with Boston University focuses on identifying risk and protective factors across multiple social contexts.

**Key Objectives:**
- Map prevalence and patterns of identity-based harassment
- Identify social-ecological predictors and consequences
- Develop evidence-based recommendations for schools and communities

### **Social-Emotional Learning Effectiveness Study**
**Multi-site evaluation | Co-Investigator: Dr. Gabriel J. Merrin**

Evaluating the differential effectiveness of universal SEL programming across diverse student populations using advanced statistical modeling approaches.

### **Adverse Childhood Experiences & Resilience**
**Longitudinal analysis | Ongoing**

Examining how adverse childhood experiences interact with protective factors to influence peer relationships and behavioral outcomes during adolescence.

## Lab Philosophy

We believe in:
- **Methodological rigor** combined with practical relevance
- **Open science** practices and reproducible research
- **Collaborative** approaches that bridge research and practice
- **Equity-focused** research that centers marginalized voices
- **Translation** of findings into actionable prevention strategies

## Research Methods & Tools

Our lab specializes in:
- **Longitudinal data analysis** (growth curve modeling, survival analysis)
- **Mixture modeling** approaches (LCA, GMM, LTA)
- **Machine learning** applications in prevention research
- **Network analysis** for understanding peer relationships
- **Reproducible workflows** using R, Python, and version control
- **Community-based participatory research** methods

## Collaborate With Us

We welcome collaborations with:
- Schools and educational organizations
- Community-based organizations serving youth
- Researchers studying adolescent development
- Prevention practitioners and program developers
- Graduate students interested in prevention science

## Lab Resources

### Publications & Presentations
Our lab has published extensively in top-tier journals including *Prevention Science*, *Journal of School Mental Health*, *Psychology of Violence*, and *Developmental Psychology*.

### Data & Code Sharing
We are committed to open science practices and regularly share de-identified datasets and analysis code to advance the field.

### Training Opportunities
We provide training in advanced quantitative methods, prevention science, and reproducible research practices for students and early-career researchers.
