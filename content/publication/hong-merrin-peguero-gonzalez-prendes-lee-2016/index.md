abstract: Background - Despite the growing presence of immigrant families in the US, little is known about physical fighting in school among youth from those families. Objective - The present study examines the social-ecological determinants of school physical fighting among youth in immigrant families. Implications for practice are also discussed. Method - Using the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study data set, the study sample consisted of 4288 immigrant students in 9thâ€“12th grade. Models were estimated using multivariate logistic regression. Variables in the individual, family, friend/peer, and school contexts were included by fitting four hierarchical logistic models to the data. Results - Results indicated that youth in immigrant families who are males, in lower grade level, racial/ethnic minorities, and of low family socio-economic status (individual) were likely to engage in physical fights. Youth in immigrant families who feel detached from their parents (family); speak another language with friends (friend/peer); and perceive school discipline to be unfair, feel discriminated against by teachers, and who perceive school crimes to be a problem (school) are also at an elevated risk of physical fights. Conclusion - Findings from the study contribute to a growing body of research on youth in immigrant families.
