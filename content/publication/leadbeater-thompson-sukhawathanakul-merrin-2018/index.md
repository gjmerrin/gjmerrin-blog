abstract: Research on the processes that enhance implementation fidelity is needed to increase understanding of ways to advance the uptake and sustainability of evidence-based programs (Berkel et al. in Prevention Science, 12, 23–33, 2011; Berkel et al. 2017). We propose and test a theoretical model of interrelations among implementation fidelity (i.e., adherence to program components), and rarely investigated activities of program users thatmay enhance fidelity; namely integration of program strategies into daily activities and children’s use of program strategies (CUoPS). These were assessed across the initial 2 years of the implementation of the WITS peer victimization prevention programs in 16 Canadian rural schools. WITS stands for Walk away, Ignore, Talk it out, and Seek help. All schools were implementing the program.We examined the interrelations among these implementation indicators and their effects on child outcomes targeted by the WITS Programs (i.e., social responsibility, prosocial leadership, peer victimization, emotional symptoms, and aggression). Four implementation assessments were collected fromchildren (n = 1326), their parents, and teachers in the fall and spring of two academic years. The within-time correlations among fidelity, integration, and CUoPSwere significant at each assessment. Cross-lagged models showed fidelity and integration, and CUoPS and integration were reciprocally related during each academic year. CUoPS predicted higher subsequent levels of fidelity during and across academic years. Suggestions are given for training and coaching to enhance teachers’ integration of program strategies into daily life and for creating opportunities for school staff to observe children using program strategies in order to enhance implementation fidelity.

summary: This study examined processes that may impact implementation fidelity in the course of an effectiveness evaluation of the WITS Programs in which all school were implementing the programs. The programs were being implemented in 16 elementary schools in rural or suburban school districts from Alberta, Ontario, and New Brunswick. We assessed indices of implementation fidelity as well as teacher integration of program strategies into their daily practice, and children’s use of WITS strategies (CUoPS) four times over two academic years. We examine the stability of and interactions among fidelity, integration, and CUoPS and also examine their impact on intervention outcomes targeted by the WITS Programs.
