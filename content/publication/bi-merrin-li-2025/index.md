This methodological paper addresses a critical challenge in non-experimental psychological research by providing researchers with practical tools for evaluating unmeasured confounding through E-values. The work contributes to enhancing the rigor and transparency of causal inferences in developmental and prevention science.

## Methodological Contribution

The paper provides:
- Step-by-step guidance for computing E-values
- Practical interpretation frameworks
- Applied examples from psychological research
- R code and tutorials for implementation

## Significance for Field

This work enhances:
- Rigor in causal inference
- Transparency in research reporting
- Critical evaluation of study findings
- Reproducibility of research practices

## Applications

E-values are particularly valuable for:
- Longitudinal developmental studies
- Prevention program evaluations
- Observational research designs
- Studies with potential unmeasured confounders
