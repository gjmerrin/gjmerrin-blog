Dr. Gabriel "Joey" Merrin is an assistant professor in the Department of Human Development and Family Studies (HDFS) at Texas Tech University. Trained as a developmental psychologist and applied methodologist, Dr. Merrin leverages novel statistical methods to answer questions about adolescence development. Dr. Merrin has extensive experience conducting school based research and has worked with students, teachers, and parents for over ten years. Dr. Merrin is currently teaching *Quantitative Mehtods III* in Fall 2019 and will teach *Risk-Taking and Adolescent Health* in Spring 2020. 

*Dr. Merrin is currently accepting students for Fall 2020*

**Research Focus:**

The development of aggression and problem behavior — both as the perpetrator (e.g., bullying, delinquency, substance use) and the recipient (e.g., victimization) — has a critical impact on long-term individual development. Informed by social-ecological models of development, my program of research seeks to clarify the developmental pathways underlying the emergence of substance use, aggression, problem behavior, and victimization in the transition from adolescence to young adulthood. I am particularly interested in the development of these behaviors among various minority and oppressed groups (i.e., race, LGBT, disability). Broadly, the aim of my work examines the following questions: (1) what are the long-term processes that support and mitigate the development of substance use, aggression, problem behavior, and victimization; (2) when and for whom do these processes differ; (3) to what extent do these processes interact to influence development; and (4) how can these findings be leveraged to influence prevention and intervention efforts?
